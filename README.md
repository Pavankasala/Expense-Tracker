# 🚀 Expense Tracker API (FastAPI)

A **RESTful Expense Tracking & Analytics API** built using **Python and FastAPI**, designed with **clean architecture principles**.  
The application allows users to record expenses and retrieve **category-wise and monthly analytics** via HTTP endpoints.

This project demonstrates **backend development**, **API design**, **data aggregation**, and **modular Python architecture**.

## ✨ Features

### 📌 Core Functionality
- Add expenses via REST API
- Retrieve all stored expenses
- Delete expenses using a **unique ID**
- Persistent storage using JSON

### 📊 Analytics
- **Category-wise expense summary**
- **Monthly expense aggregation**
- Server-side computation of insights (not just CRUD)

### 🧱 Architecture
- Clean separation of concerns
- Modular and scalable project structure
- Easily extendable to SQLite / PostgreSQL

🔌 API Endpoints
➕ Add Expense

POST /expenses

{
  "amount": 250,
  "category": "Food",
  "description": "Lunch"
}

📄 Get All Expenses

GET /expenses

❌ Delete Expense

DELETE /expenses/{expense_id}

📊 Category Analytics

GET /analytics/category

Response Example:

{
  "Food": 1200,
  "Travel": 800
}

GET /analytics/monthly

Response Example:

{
  "2025-01": 3200,
  "2025-02": 1800

🧠 Design Decisions:

Used UUID-based identifiers for safe and stable deletion

Implemented clean architecture for readability and scalability

Separated analytics logic for easier testing and maintenance

Started with JSON persistence for simplicity, with clear upgrade paths

🔮 Future Enhancements:

Replace JSON with SQLite / PostgreSQL

Add authentication (API Key / JWT)

Export analytics to CSV

Dockerize the application

Add automated tests
